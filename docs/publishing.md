# Publishing Plan

This document describes how the `oda-agent-kit` workspace packages are published to npm,
including publishing order, versioning, pre-release strategy, and install examples.

---

## Packages

The repo publishes four scoped public packages:

```text
@oda-agent/core
@oda-agent/cli
@oda-agent/mcp-server
@oda-agent/openclaw-plugin
```

All packages use the `@oda-agent` npm scope. Scoped packages default to **private**
on npm, so every `npm publish` command must include `--access public`.

Each package ships only compiled output. The `"files"` field in each
`package.json` controls what is included in the published tarball:

| Package | Published files |
|---------|----------------|
| `@oda-agent/core` | `dist/` |
| `@oda-agent/cli` | `dist/` |
| `@oda-agent/mcp-server` | `dist/` |
| `@oda-agent/openclaw-plugin` | `dist/`, `openclaw.plugin.json`, `skills/` |

Source files, tests, and `tsconfig.json` are never included.

## npm workspace behavior

This repo is an npm workspace monorepo. A few important behaviors to keep in mind
when publishing:

- Running `npm publish` from the **repo root** without a `--workspace` flag
  will fail because the root `package.json` is `"private": true`.
- Each package must be published individually. Both the workspace path form
  (`--workspace=packages/core`) and the package-name form
  (`--workspace=@oda-agent/core`) work; the examples below use the path form.
- Workspace-local cross-dependencies currently use `"*"` (plain npm range, **not**
  the `workspace:` protocol). The published tarball will therefore contain `"*"` as
  the core dependency version, meaning any published version of `@oda-agent/core`
  satisfies the requirement. To get deterministic pinning at publish time, migrate
  to explicit version ranges (e.g. `"^0.2.0"`) or the `workspace:^` protocol before
  each release.
- Always build (`npm run build`) **before** publishing so that `dist/` is up to date.

---

## Publishing order

`core` must always be published first because the adapter packages
(`cli`, `mcp-server`, `openclaw-plugin`) depend on it:

```bash
# 1. Build everything
npm run build

# 2. Publish in dependency order
npm publish --workspace=packages/core --access public
npm publish --workspace=packages/cli --access public
npm publish --workspace=packages/mcp-server --access public
npm publish --workspace=packages/openclaw-plugin --access public
```

---

## Why `core` is published separately

- Adapter packages (`cli`, `mcp-server`, `openclaw-plugin`) each bring their
  own heavy dependencies (commander, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, etc.).
- Consumers who only need the Oda API client types should be able to install
  `@oda-agent/core` without pulling in CLI or MCP tooling.
- `core` can be reused by future adapters without any circular dependencies.
- Publishing `core` independently lets library authors extend the toolkit without
  depending on any specific runtime (Node CLI, stdio server, OpenClaw, etc.).

---

## CLI `bin` behavior

`@oda-agent/cli` registers a binary named **`oda`** via the `"bin"` field in its
`package.json`:

```json
{
  "bin": {
    "oda": "dist/bin.js"
  }
}
```

When a user installs the package globally, npm places `oda` on their `PATH`.
When installed locally (e.g. in a project), npm creates `node_modules/.bin/oda`
which can be invoked via `npx oda` or as an npm script.

---

## Versioning

All packages in this repo follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Change type | Example bump |
|-------------|-------------|
| Breaking API change | `0.1.0` → `1.0.0` |
| New backwards-compatible feature | `0.1.0` → `0.2.0` |
| Bug fix / patch | `0.1.0` → `0.1.1` |

Keep **all four packages at the same version** to avoid cross-package confusion.
Before tagging or running the publish workflow, manually update the `version` field
in every `package.json` to the target version. The publish workflow does **not**
bump versions automatically — it only builds and publishes whatever version is
already set in `package.json`.

### Pre-release versions for testing

Before a stable release, publish a tagged pre-release to let users test in
Claude Desktop / OpenClaw without affecting the `latest` dist-tag:

| Stage | Version example | npm dist-tag |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Early preview | `0.2.0-alpha.1` | `alpha` |
| Feature-complete but untested | `0.2.0-beta.1` | `beta` |
| Release candidate | `0.2.0-rc.1` | `rc` |
| Stable | `0.2.0` | `latest` |

Publish a pre-release using the `--tag` flag (this prevents the pre-release
from becoming the default `latest` version):

```bash
npm publish --workspace=packages/core --access public --tag beta
npm publish --workspace=packages/cli --access public --tag beta
npm publish --workspace=packages/mcp-server --access public --tag beta
npm publish --workspace=packages/openclaw-plugin --access public --tag beta
```

Install a specific pre-release tag:

```bash
# Install beta version
npm install @oda-agent/cli@beta

# Install a specific pre-release version
npm install @oda-agent/mcp-server@0.2.0-beta.1
```

Promote a pre-release to `latest` when it is ready:

```bash
npm dist-tag add @oda-agent/core@0.2.0-rc.1 latest
npm dist-tag add @oda-agent/cli@0.2.0-rc.1 latest
npm dist-tag add @oda-agent/mcp-server@0.2.0-rc.1 latest
npm dist-tag add @oda-agent/openclaw-plugin@0.2.0-rc.1 latest
```

## GitHub Actions publish workflow

A reusable publish workflow lives at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. It can be
triggered two ways:

1. **Tag push** — push a tag matching `v*` (e.g. `v0.2.0` or `v0.2.0-beta.1`)
   and the workflow publishes automatically.
2. **Manual dispatch** — go to _Actions → Publish packages → Run workflow_ in the
   GitHub UI and choose the dist-tag (`latest`, `rc`, `beta`, `alpha`).

The workflow builds all packages and publishes them in the correct order using the
`NPM_TOKEN` secret that must be set in the repository's _Settings → Secrets_.

See `.github/workflows/publish.yml` for the full configuration.
